	<p>James was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the early 90s. His father was in the Army so he moved around a lot early on, but his mom left his dad and finally settled down in Tennessee where James would spend the next 22 years of his life. During his last years in Tennessee, he attended Vanderbilt University where he finally acted on his passion for football and walked onto the football team. After graduating from Vanderbilt University, he was offered and accepted a job in Atlanta, Georgia where he now resides with his dog Duke; yet his heart still resides in Nashville with his team.</p>
